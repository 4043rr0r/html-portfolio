<p>Goated movie for a reason. Nothing really comes close to the message and the beauty of this masterpiece.</p>

<i> <b>  “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things  <br>and no good thing ever dies”</i>
</b>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>

<p>Another exquisite movie, this time from nolan. A wonderful documentary through the darkening life of an innocent Robert Oppenheimer.</p>

<i> <b>  “Can you hear the music, Robert?” </i>
</b>


<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>

<p>All I wish, is to have a teacher like Mr Keating. </p> 
 <i> <b>  “The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse, <br>what will yours be?”</i>
